	<b>Etiquette note:</b> Though it is obviously okay for a sender to reveal
	their <i>own</i> letter for pretty much any reason, a recipient should 
	generally respect the protections that were applied by the sender.  
	Exceptions would be cases such as proving to the public that the missing parts
	do not contain authentic information (and thus do not warrant response).</p>	
</div>

<br />

<p>Remember that you can still send the certificates to any party who wants to verify 
the letter without publishing it to the world!  So reveal only if you are the sender
or if you are certain it is warranted.  If you are sure you want to reveal, click the 
button below.</p>
