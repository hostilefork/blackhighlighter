		<p>Write the full, <b>unabridged</b> version of your letter below.
		None of what you write will be sent over the network until you've had
		a chance to mark which parts you want to protect.  Provide all relevant information for the recipient to follow up with you, just as you would
		in a typical private email.</p>

		<p>When you've finished, click the button below to continue to the

			a local application with auto-save, and then paste here when you are
			finished.</p>
