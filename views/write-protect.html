<p>Now it's time to pull out your "black highlighter" and protect any sensitive
information you don't want posted to the public.  Anything marked in orange is
a suggestion you can protect with a single click (email addresses, etc.)
Click on a protected section to un-protect it, and you can go back and make 
changes to the text by clicking on the "Compose" tab.</p>

<p>You won't be sending the marked out text of your
	letter to the server.  However, you will be sending a digital verification
	number that can be used by you or the recipient to prove what you wrote.
	(To understand how this is possible,	<a href="{% url cryptography_named_url %}" target="_blank">read this</a>.
	Everything you do not mark out will be published to the server.  </p>

{# {% comment %} #}<!--
	Contents will be copied here from editor-compose textarea when tab is switched
	When tab is switched back to compose, any protection changes are copied back
-->{# {% endcomment %} #}
<div class="textarea-wrapper">
	<textarea id="editor-protect" class="document-display"></textarea>
</div>

<p>When you're satisfied that everything you didn't mark out is okay to publish
on the internet so anyone can see it, continue.</p>
