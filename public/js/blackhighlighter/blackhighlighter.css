 * Text nodes in the protection area itself are intentionally not marked with
 * the black highlighter selection style.  This is because of the poor handling
 * of custom selection colors in webkit for such nodes.  The protection area
 * must clean up *any* direct children and convert them into divs before
 * running the protect process!  So don't add .protection-area::selection here
 * to try and solve a problem; fix the canonization before the protect instead.
