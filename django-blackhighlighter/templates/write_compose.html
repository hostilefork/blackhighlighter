<p>Write the full, <b>unabridged</b> version of your letter below.  None of what you write 
will be sent over the network until you've had a chance to mark which parts you want to 
protect.  (<a href="{% url network_named_url %}" target="_blank">"How can I verify this?"</a>)
Provide all relevant information for the recipient to follow up with you, just as you would
in a typical private email.</p>

Contents will be copied from here to #editor-protect when the tab is switched.
These contents are then overwritten if the user switches back
Currently making sure textarea starts out EMPTY!  No spaces, newlines, or breaks between start and end tag.
Browsers vary widely: http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/rich-html-editing-in-the-browser-part-1/

<textarea id="editor-compose" style="width: 100%; height: 200px;"></textarea>

<br />
<p>When you've finished, click the button below to continue to the protect phase (you will
still be able to come back and make changes if necessary.)</p>

<center><p>
	<a class="button" href="#" onclick="WriteLetter.nextStep();">
		<img src="{{ BLACKHIGHLIGHTER_MEDIA_URL }}button.png" alt="" />Next step: <b>Protect</b>
	</a>
</p></center>

<div class="ui-state-highlight ui-corner-all" style="margin-top: 20px; padding: 0 .7em;"> 
	<p><span class="ui-icon ui-icon-info" style="float: left; margin-right: .3em;"></span>
	<strong>Note:</strong> Because what you type is not being sent to our server until
	after you've taken out the parts you want to protect, we are not saving a copy
	as you type.  So if your browser or computer crashes, you'll lose your letter.
	You might want to compose in another program with auto-save, and then paste
	it here when you are finished.</p>
