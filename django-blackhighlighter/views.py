#  want to bookmark them and refreshing a web page does not re-issue 
#  any AJAX requests (except those fired on page load). Therefore I 
#  have no problem with returning entitiest (HTML fragments, JSON, XML) 
#  from AJAX POSTs - PRG is not of much use here."

#
# VIEWS FOR THE "ABOUT" PAGES
# Before breaking blackhighlighter into its own app, I used to have these in
# the urls like this:
#
#   url(r'^about/credits/$', direct_to_template, {'template': 'credits.html'}, 'credits_named_url'),
# 
# However, I switched this to exposing views from blackhighlighter instead of
# templates.  The reason being there's no template loader parameterized by app,
# so the site can't say "load template about/credits.html from blackhighlighter".
# It seemed to break encapsulation to say "look for about/credits.html in all apps"
#
# See:
# http://www.djangobook.com/en/2.0/chapter11/
# http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/templates/api/#loading-templates
#
# These are not loaded directly via reverse, but rather by name.  This way you
# can easily override them in the urls.py -- I'm not sure if this is the right
# way to go long term so it's more of an experiment.
#
